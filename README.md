# webUp
A 6MB windows application to continuously monitor any webiste that is down and ring an alarm when it is back.

What can this app do ?
1. This application will continously monitor any URL that you provide while it is down.
2. Once the site is back up, it opens the URL in a new tab with your default browser and rings an alarm to notify you.
3. Instead of refreshing the page again and again, you can rely on the program to alert you when it is back up.

Possible use-cases: Flash Sales, any site that goes down due to traffic and you need to reach the site as soon as it is back.

Two versions of the webUp app have been provided in this repository.

1. End-user version - can use EITHER of the 2 files webUp.exe or WebUpGUI.exe, however we recommend weUpGUI for smoother user experience.
2. Developer version - contains a single 2KB .py file, python developers can make changes to the code directly to add any customizations according to their specific requirements.

NOTE: Instructions on how-to-use are present within the app.
NOTE: Developer version may require dependencies to install before using.
